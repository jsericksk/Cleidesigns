The main objective of this project is to create interfaces using both XML and Jetpack Compose, taking inspiration from designs found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com).

For better organization, each design is in a separate module, having files that correspond only to the design itself, such as strings, drawables, fonts, etc. The architecture is inspired by [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid).

It's a personal project just for fun. :)
