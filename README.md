The main objective of this project is to create interfaces using both XML and Jetpack Compose, taking inspiration from designs found on [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com). It's not the main goal to make designs exactly the same as inspired designs and there may be small differences between the XML and Jetpack Compose versions of the designs.

For better organization, each design is in a separate module, having files that correspond only to the design itself, such as strings, drawables, fonts, etc. The architecture is inspired by [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid).

It's a personal project just for fun. :)
