This project was created with the purpose of exercising and improving my knowledge in creating Android interfaces.
In addition to trying to get close to the original design, I'm trying to use components and implementations that would normally be used in a "real" scenario, since if the goal was just to make it look similar, some of the item lists could be created with just component duplication, instead of using a RecyclerView and all that it implies (adapters, models etc.), for example.

In addition to the traditional XML implementation, the project also contains versions created using Jetpack Compose, which in my humble opinion is already much faster, easier and more intuitive to create interfaces.

## Organization

Designs are separated into folders for better organization, such as **design1, design2, design3...**, where each folder contains classes used in that design itself, such as models or utils classes.
Specific design files contain a prefix to better identify which screen the file is being used on, such as **design1_image**.

## Test it yourself

You can download the app to test on your device, just access the project  [releases](https://github.com/jsericksk/Cleidesigns/releases) and download the apk.
